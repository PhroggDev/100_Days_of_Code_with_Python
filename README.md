# 100 Days of Code: Python3 Style

Here is where I am documenting my progress thru a popular, and inexpensive, course for learning modern/contemporary [Python3](https://www.python.org/). Anyone perusing the commit history will quickly notice that I do not use the *day* moniker literally. I think of the ***100 Days*** as 100 steps. Someone new to Python might use or need a day for each step. The 100 day paradigm makes sense for such folk. I, however, have been scripting some **very** simple scripts as a bit of hobby for many years. Python has been a hobby for more years than I care to admit. At this late date I really should be proficient with Python in multiple flavors. But alas, I am not. Thus -> yet another in a growing string of formal courses that aim to teach coding with Python.

I expect to get thru the first 15 days in the first day or two. If nothing else this should aid me in honing my skillz for maintaining a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/)


## ToDo
